## What is a TUI?

This application uses a Text User Interface (TUI) - it runs in your terminal but provides a graphical-like experience with:
- Mouse support
- Buttons and forms
- Colored interface
- Keyboard navigation

Think of it as a GUI that runs in your terminal!

## Supported ISPs

- **Singtel** - Fully tested and working
- **Starhub** - Fully tested and working

Note: M1 and SIMBA are also Wireless@SG operators but their API endpoints are not publicly available for this registration method.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Linux with NetworkManager or systemd-networkd
- Active Singapore mobile number for OTP

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to NetworkManager"**
   - Ensure NetworkManager is running: `sudo systemctl start NetworkManager`

2. **"Keyring access denied"**
   - Install gnome-keyring or similar: `sudo apt install gnome-keyring`

3. **"OTP timeout"**
   - The application will offer to resend OTP
   - Check your phone number is correct

### Manual Network Configuration

If automatic configuration fails, you can manually configure using the displayed credentials:

1. Open your network settings
2. Add new WiFi connection
3. Settings:
   - SSID: `Wireless@SGx`
   - Security: WPA & WPA2 Enterprise
   - Authentication: PEAP
   - Inner Authentication: MSCHAPv2
   - Username: [displayed username]
   - Password: [displayed password]
