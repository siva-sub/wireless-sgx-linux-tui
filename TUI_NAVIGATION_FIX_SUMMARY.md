# TUI Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing AutoConnectScreen Registration**
   - Added `"autoconnect": AutoConnectScreen` to the `SCREENS` dictionary in `app.py`
   - This was causing navigation failures when trying to access the auto-connect feature

2. **Duplicate AutoConnectScreen Definition**
   - Removed the inline `AutoConnectScreen` class definition from the `_auto_connect` method
   - Now properly uses the imported `AutoConnectScreen` from `screens/autoconnect.py`

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error handling to the `_auto_connect` method
   - Enhanced `push_screen` method with proper error handling and logging
   - Added try-catch blocks to prevent app crashes on navigation errors

4. **Missing Import**
   - Added `Button` import to `app.py` (required by ManualInstructionsScreen)

5. **Welcome Screen Error Handling**
   - Added error handling to the welcome screen's button handler

## Changes Made

### 1. `/wirelesssgx/app.py`

- **Line 4**: Added `Button` to imports
- **Line 82**: Added `"autoconnect": AutoConnectScreen` to SCREENS dictionary
- **Lines 98-126**: Rewrote `_auto_connect` method to:
  - Use proper error handling with try-catch
  - Use the registered autoconnect screen instead of inline class
  - Show user-friendly error messages
- **Lines 128-155**: Enhanced `push_screen` method with:
  - Validation of screen names
  - Error logging
  - Fallback error display
  - Prevention of app crashes

### 2. `/wirelesssgx/screens/welcome.py`

- **Lines 71-90**: Added try-catch block to `on_button_pressed` method

## How It Works Now

1. When a user clicks "Auto-Connect" in the TUI:
   - The `action_auto_connect` method is called
   - It creates an async task for `_auto_connect`
   - `_auto_connect` checks for saved credentials
   - If credentials exist, it pushes the registered "autoconnect" screen
   - If no credentials or an error occurs, it shows a user-friendly error message

2. The `push_screen` method now:
   - Validates that the requested screen exists in the SCREENS dictionary
   - Handles errors during screen instantiation
   - Shows error messages without crashing the app
   - Logs errors for debugging (when logging is available)

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Run the TUI: `wirelesssgx`
2. Click "Auto-Connect (Saved Credentials)"
3. The app should either:
   - Show the auto-connect screen if credentials are saved
   - Show an error message if no credentials are found
   - Handle any other errors gracefully without crashing

The navigation should now work smoothly without crashes, matching the behavior of the CLI commands.
